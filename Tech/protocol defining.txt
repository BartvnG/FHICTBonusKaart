protocol from arduino to forms:

#CheckIn 09 B9 64 C2 4 25 1 % //Spaces in uid, how to fix? 

//Use string.Split('!') to split the data into stuff
//It will read a substring if the message starts with "#CheckIn "
//This makes it possible to read the entire message at once
// message would look like this:
#CheckIn 09 B9 64 C2!1%

(Uid, opTijd(bool))

forms app calculates points
forms app sends calculated data back to arduino
